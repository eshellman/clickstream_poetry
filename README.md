A clickstream poem, "My clicks are mine", and performance script

This is a python script that "performs" a poem for the benefit of anyone listening to the user's clickstream. The Creative Commons  reserves to me the right to distribute copies of the poem for commercial purposes. If an ISP tries to sell a copy of the clickstream, they would be violating the license, and thus infringing my copyright to the poem. 

If I tried to sue an ISP for copyright infringement, they would likely argue that though my creation is original and they used it inits entirety, selling my clickstream was a "fair use". They would assert that advertising optimization (or whatever) was a "transformative use" and that it didn't affect the market for my poem. Who would pay anything for a stupid clickstream poem? How would the non-existent, hypothetical market for clickstream poetry be harmed by use in their big data algorithms?

That's why I'm offering commercial licenses to the clickstream poem "My clicks are mine". For only $10, you can use a copy of my poem for any use whatsoever, for a period of 24 hours. I imagine that, over the lifetime of my poem's copyright protection (into the 22nd century), clickstream poetry will become increasingly valuable because of uses that haven't been invented yet.

To acquire a commercial license to "My clicks are mine", support my work at the [Free Ebook Foundation](http://ebookfoundation.org), a 501(c)3 not-for-profit corporation, by making a donation. Or don't. I have no idea if a court would take my side against an ISP. I'm told that judges are generally skeptical of "legal hacks" unless they are crafted by lawyers instead of engineers.
